Prerequisites:

* (BeautifulSoup 4)[1] is used for working with the HTML tree. 

* We use (python-wikitools)[2] to access the MediaWiki API. Actually, this
  isn't needed any more, since we pull everything we need from the
  HTML.  I am, however, thinking of adding some other features that
  would require (or benifit from) something like this.
